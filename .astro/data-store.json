I've been using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for years and it's been a reliable editor, but recently I decided to make the switch to Neovim. In this blog post, I'll explain why I made the switch and why you might want to consider it too.\n\nFirst, let's talk about what Neovim is. Neovim is a fork of Vim, a highly customizable text editor that's been around since the 90s. Neovim is built to be more modern and extensible than Vim, with a focus on making it easier to develop plugins and integrate with other tools. Neovim also has a more consistent and flexible scripting language, making it easier to automate tasks and customize your workflow.\n\n![my currently neovim](/images/switching_from_vscode_to_nvim.png)\n\n\nSo why did I switch from VSCode to Neovim? There were a few reasons:\n\n## Performance\nOne of the main reasons I switched to Neovim was for its performance. While VSCode is a great editor, it can be a bit slow and bloated at times. Neovim, on the other hand, is incredibly lightweight and fast. It loads up almost instantly and I can open and switch between files with ease.\n\n## Customizability\nAnother reason I switched to Neovim was for its customizability. Neovim has an extensive plugin ecosystem and can be customized to suit your needs. With a few tweaks to my configuration file, I was able to create a highly personalized environment that perfectly suited my workflow. VSCode is also highly customizable, but I found that I had to install a lot of extensions to get it to work the way I wanted.\n\n## Modal Editing\nNeovim uses a modal editing system, which can take a bit of getting used to, but is incredibly powerful once you get the hang of it. The modal editing system allows you to use different keystrokes to perform different actions, depending on which mode you're in. This can greatly speed up your workflow once you get used to it. VSCode, on the other hand, uses a more traditional text editor interface.\n\n## Terminal Integration\nOne of the things I love about Neovim is its terminal integration. I can run shell commands and interact with my terminal directly from within Neovim, without having to switch to a separate terminal window. This has been a game-changer for my workflow and has allowed me to streamline my development process.\n\nOverall, I'm really happy with my switch to Neovim. While there was a bit of a learning curve at first, I found that the benefits outweighed the initial investment. If you're looking for a lightweight, customizable, and powerful code editor, I would definitely recommend giving Neovim a try.","src/content/post/switching_from_vscode_to_nvim.md","c803bd0bc3e5379c",{"html":24,"metadata":25},"\u003Cp>As a programmer, one of the most important tools in my arsenal is my code editor.

One of the most useful features of Git is Git Bisect. Git Bisect allows you to find the exact commit that introduced a bug by performing a binary search on the commit history. I personally discovered this feature just over a year ago, and it has become an invaluable tool in my workflow.\n\nGit Bisect works by first identifying a good commit (one that doesn't contain the bug) and a bad commit (one that does contain the bug). It then performs a binary search on the commit history between those two commits, checking out commits and asking you to confirm whether the bug is present or not. With each confirmation, Git Bisect eliminates half of the remaining commits until it finds the exact commit that introduced the bug.\n\nTo demonstrate how Git Bisect works, let's consider the following scenario. Suppose you're working on a project and you've noticed a bug in the latest version. You know that the bug wasn't present in an earlier version of the codebase, but you're not sure when it was introduced. Here's how you could use Git Bisect to find the offending commit:\n\n1. Identify a good commit and a bad commit\n\n```\n$ git bisect start\n$ git bisect bad \u003Clatest_commit>\n$ git bisect good \u003Cearlier_commit>\n```\n\n2. You will then need to test whether the bug is present in this commit, by running your code and checking whether the bug occurs. If it is present, run the following command:\n\n```\n$ git bisect bad\n```\n\n3. If it's not present, run:\n\n```\n$ git bisect good\n```\n\nRepeat step 2 until Git Bisect finds the exact commit that introduced the bug.\nOnce Git Bisect has identified the offending commit, you can use Git's built-in tools to view the changes made in that commit and fix the bug.\n\nIn conclusion, Git Bisect is a powerful feature that can save you a lot of time and effort when debugging your code. It's amazing that even after years of working with Git, I only discovered this feature just over a year ago.

They are used to model relationships and connections between objects or data points. In this article, we will explore the basics of graphs and how to implement them in TypeScript, a popular programming language.\n\n## Graph Basics\n\nA graph is a collection of vertices (also called nodes) and edges. Vertices represent objects or data points, while edges represent the relationships or connections between them. There are two main types of graphs: directed and undirected.\n\nIn a directed graph, the edges have a direction and represent a one-way relationship between two vertices. For example, in a social media graph, an edge from vertex A to vertex B could represent A following B, but not vice versa.\n\nIn an undirected graph, the edges do not have a direction and represent a two-way relationship between two vertices. For example, in a road network graph, an edge between two cities represents a connection that can be traveled in both directions.\n\n## Implementing Graphs in TypeScript\n\nTo implement a graph in TypeScript, we can use an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix. An adjacency list is an array of arrays, where each inner array represents a vertex and its neighbors. An adjacency matrix is a two-dimensional array that represents the edges between vertices.\n\nHere is an example of implementing an adjacency list in TypeScript:\n\n```typescript\nclass Graph {\n  private vertices: number;\n  private adjList: Map\u003Cnumber, number[]>;\n\n  constructor(vertices: number) {\n    this.vertices = vertices;\n    this.adjList = new Map\u003Cnumber, number[]>();\n    for (let i = 0; i \u003C this.vertices; i++) {\n      this.adjList.set(i, []);\n    }\n  }\n\n  addEdge(v: number, w: number) {\n    this.adjList.get(v).push(w);\n    this.adjList.get(w).push(v);\n  }\n\n  printGraph() {\n    let keys = this.adjList.keys();\n    for (let i of keys) {\n      let neighbors = this.adjList.get(i);\n      let result = \"\";\n      for (let j of neighbors) {\n        result += j + \" \";\n      }\n      console.log(i + \" -> \" + result);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nlet g = new Graph(4);\ng.addEdge(0, 1);\ng.addEdge(0, 2);\ng.addEdge(1, 2);\ng.addEdge(2, 3);\ng.printGraph();\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a Graph class that uses a Map to store the adjacency list. We also define methods to add edges and print the graph.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGraphs are a powerful tool for modeling relationships and connections between objects or data points. In TypeScript, we can implement graphs using an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix. By understanding the basics of graphs and how to implement them in TypeScript, we can use them to solve complex problems in computer science and beyond.\n\n## Learn more\n1. \"Introduction to Graph Theory\" by Richard J.
